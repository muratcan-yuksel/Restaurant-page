<h2>Restaurant Page</h2>
<p>A restaurant page done by HTML/CSS, Javascript and Webpack</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of this project was to get introduced with Webpack</li>
<li>The elements are dymanically coded via DOM</li>
<li>I had some problems when trying to host the page via github pages</li>
<li>The images would be seen locally, but wouldn't show up on github pages</li>
<li> The easy solution was to redefine the image sources</li>
<li>So I took me image folder and put it into the dist folder, and linked them like "pics/name.jpg"</li>
<li>This worked bcs the main.js file created by webpack is in the dist folder, but I was specifying the sources regarding my own working JS file</li>
<li>DUUH, but it's main.js who's the outcome. So the images needed to be specified according to it :)</li>
</ul>
<p>This restaurant, Shabada, actually exists and is in Bordeaux/France. I worked in that restaurant during my stay in Bordeaux, and gathered some really cool memories. If you happen to drop by, please tell the owner (Ben) that Murat says hi :)</p>
